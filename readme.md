azul-17 "java-version 17.0.3"

windows 10

The picture I use is from school. They are all allowable

My size is 1280*800 which is fix. (This is the smallest size allowed)

I create all features and add sounds.

The speed of enemy in different level is different. Their difference is small. For example: 
level1: 3
level2: 4
level3: 5

with the level change, the number of enemy bullet, enemy speed, enemy bullet speed change slightly.

when finish level 1 or 2, you should press enter to continue

When finish level 3, you should press q to quit(note you can also press enter to continue but you will still at level3)

Those message will also display when you win game

Thanks a lot
